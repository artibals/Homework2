               <h2>Intro</h2>
               Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
               <br>Our solar system consists of our star, the <a href=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/>Sun</a>, 
               and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets 
               <ul>
                  <li><a href=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mercury/overview/>Mercury</a></li>
                  <li><a href=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/overview/>Venus</a></li>
                  <li><a href=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/>Earth</a></li>
                  <li><a href=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/>Mars</a></li>
                  <li><a href=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/>Jupiter</a></li>
                  <li><a href=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/>Saturn</a></li>
                  <li><a href=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/uranus/overview/>Uranus</a></li>
                  <li><a href=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/neptune/overview/>Neptune</a></li>
               </ul>
               and dwarf planets such as <a href=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/dwarf-planets/pluto/overview/>Pluto</a>, 
               dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids. 
               <br>Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting 
               other stars in the Milky Way, there are more planets than stars in night sky. 
               <br>So far, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way, 
               with more planets being found all the time. 
               <br>Most of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy are thought to have planets of their own, 
               and the Milky Way is but one of perhaps 100 billion galaxies in the universe.

               <h2>Voyager - to Infinite and Beyond</h2>
               <p>The twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft are exploring where nothing from Earth has flown before. 
               Continuing on their more-than-40-year journey since their 1977 launches, 
               they each are much farther away from Earth and the sun than Pluto. 
               In August 2012, Voyager 1 made the historic entry into interstellar space, 
               the region between stars, filled with material ejected by the death of nearby stars millions of years ago. 
               Voyager 2 entered interstellar space on November 5, 2018 and scientists hope to learn more about this region.
               oth spacecraft are still sending scientific information about their surroundings through the Deep Space Network,
               or DSN.

               The primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn.
               After making a string of discoveries there — such as active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io and 
               intricacies of Saturn's rings — the mission was extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, 
               and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The adventurers' current mission, 
               the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM), will explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain. And beyond.</p>
